# Digital Interaction Projects
 
## Motivation, Idea and Driving Principles

Motivation & Idea:
Use Computer Vision and AI to create enriching experiences for people to interact with cameras and digital displays.

Driving Principles:
* Attribution: this might be the most important driving principle, I want everyone to understand where I get my ideas from, art by definition is copying. We get our ideas from the world around us. A lot of AI and Computer Vision has been reversing attribution and I applaud the efforts of some (e.g https://www.stableattribution.com/) on trying and reverse this.
* Have Fun
* Involve people

Long term vision is to have this set-up at parties that we throw or that our friends throw, it should be a robust experience enchancer. Just as lazers and light shows can be so much fun, I want interactive digital art to be a new dimension we can add to parties for people to have fun. 


## Organization of the repo

** utils
    Common utilities to all projects such as loading/saving images, async processing pipelines, etc...

** data
    Any relevant data used for the projects
** Project xx00
    Each project will have it's own folder. 
    In each folder you can find an idea.txt file which will state the project idea and point to some available wireframes 

## Documentation of ideas

We could use notion as a database of links and images for better visual understanding. Github only will be limiting.
