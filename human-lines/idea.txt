The idea here is to get things kicked off - this is officially the first digital art project I am embarking on. 

I wanted to use previous knowledge I have, a simple idea came to mind, humans as lines. 

The aim is to take a video input of a human dancing or moving and convert that to a line on a white background (to start with)


Approach: 
1. Data
2. Movement/frame analysis:
    start with single frame analysis
    harmonic frequency? average frequency? --> what should we be looking at for human movement
    can we run FFT realtime?
    human extraction of frame
3. Drawing
    how to draw moving lines? must be some kind of libarary
    how can we spice this up
4. Gear
    what gear do we need to buy?
    can we use the lazer projector?

The idea behind this art project is to 

Repo Architecture: 
just write bloody code, and re-org later if needed
